# simple game 
### The game is a variable length single file boardgame.  Each player has one pawn, which begins off the board and moves onto the track with the first roll.  Each move is made according to the roll of a six-sided die.  
###      If a player lands on a square occupied by an opposing pawn, the opposing pawn is bumped off the board.
